	<h1> Three kinds of blood vessels </h1>

			<div class="vessel-title arteries-title"> Arteries </div>
			<div class="description"> The arteries are the blood vessels that deliver oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the tissues of the body. Each artery is a muscular tube lined by smooth tissue and has three layers: - the intima, the inner layer lined by a smooth tissue called endothelium, - the media, a layer of muscle that lets arteries handle the high pressures from the heart, - the adventitia, connective tissue anchoring arteries to nearby tissues. The largest artery is the aorta, the main high-pressure pipeline connected to the heart's left ventricle.

			<div class="vessel-title veins-title"> Veins </div>
			<div class="description"> Veins are blood vessels that carry blood towards the heart. Most veins carry deoxygenated blood from the tissues back to the heart; exceptions are the pulmonary and umbilical veins, both of which carry oxygenated blood to the heart. In contrast to veins, arteries carry blood away from the heart. </div>

			<div class="vessel-title cappilaries-title">Capillaries</div>
			<div class="description"> Capillaries are very tiny blood vessels — so small that a single red blood cell can barely fit through them. They help to connect your arteries and veins in addition to facilitating the exchange of certain elements between your blood and tissues. This is why tissues that are very active, such as your muscles, liver, and kidneys, have an abundance of capillaries. Less metabolically active tissues, such as certain types of connective tissue, don’t have as many. </div>
